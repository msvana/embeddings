# Embeddings playground

Embeddings playground is a tool that lets you quickly examine similarities between
pieces of texts by calculating the cosine distance of their embeddings.

You can try the app here: https://embeddings.svana.name/

The app requires you to provide your own API key, but everything runs locally in
your browser. You can verify this by checking the source code or the network logs.

## Building locally

The app is written in Vue. You can run it as any other Vue project, for example.

```
cd embeddings
npm install
npm run dev
```
